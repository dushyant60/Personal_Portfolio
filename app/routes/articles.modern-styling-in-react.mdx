When working with dynamic styles in React, developers often turn to CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components or Emotion. While these tools are powerful, they introduce complexity and can make styles harder to maintain. A simpler, more native approach involves leveraging CSS custom properties (CSS variables) and data attributes. Here's how you can achieve the same dynamic styling flexibility without the extra overhead of CSS-in-JS libraries.

## Why Vanilla CSS Is Back

CSS has evolved significantly, with features like custom properties and improved browser support making it easier than ever to handle dynamic styles natively. By using CSS variables and data attributes, you can maintain clean, readable styles while responding to component state changes seamlessly.

### Dynamic Values with CSS Custom Properties

Custom properties allow you to pass dynamic values to your CSS, without resorting to inline styles or heavy CSS-in-JS solutions. For example:

```jsx
function Button({ color, children }) {
  return (
    <button className="button" style={{ '--color': color }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-color: var(--color, #ddd); /* Fallback for missing color */
  color: #333;
}
```

By using `var(--color)`, you keep the styles modular and scoped within your CSS. The inline style only sets the value of `--color`, making it easy to adjust dynamically.

### Managing States with Data Attributes

Data attributes provide a declarative way to represent component states and variations. For example:

```jsx
function Button({ size, primary, children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className="button"
      data-size={size}
      data-primary={primary}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: #333;

  &[data-primary="true"] {
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: #fff;
  }

  &[data-size="small"] {
    font-size: 12px;
    padding: 5px 10px;
  }

  &[data-size="large"] {
    font-size: 18px;
    padding: 15px 30px;
  }
}
```

This approach avoids messy class string concatenations in your JSX and leverages the natural specificity of CSS to apply styles based on attributes.

## Advantages of Using Native CSS Techniques

1. **Simplicity**: CSS variables and data attributes integrate directly with standard CSS, making it easier to debug and maintain.
2. **Performance**: You avoid the runtime cost of parsing and applying styles with CSS-in-JS libraries.
3. **Readability**: Co-locating styles in CSS files keeps your code cleaner, while the use of attributes in JSX makes the component state clear.
4. **Scalability**: This approach scales well in larger projects, especially when combined with CSS Modules for scoping styles.

## Moving Forward with Native CSS

With modern CSS features and excellent browser support, there's less need to rely on CSS-in-JS solutions for dynamic styling. Instead, you can combine CSS custom properties, data attributes, and CSS Modules for a robust, maintainable styling system in your React applications.
